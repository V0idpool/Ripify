**Ripify** is a Windows app that helps you save music from Spotify playlists or albums by finding matching audio on YouTube and downloading MP3s using yt-dlp. It uses the Spotify API and YouTubeExplode under the hood to streamline the whole process of building your personal music collection.

## ⚙️ Version: 1.2
## 📅 Originally Released: 06/11/2025

## 🎵 What Ripify Does

- **Pulls tracks from Spotify**: Just drop in a public playlist or album, and Ripify will grab the track info.
- **Finds audio on YouTube**: It searches YouTube for each track and uses [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp) to download high-quality MP3s.
- **Batch downloading**: Grab multiple songs in one go, complete with progress updates and a max concurrent download of 3 (Can be increased).
- **Pick your folder**: You can choose where your music gets saved.
- **Preview before download**: See the list of songs it found before starting the download.
- **Automatic yt-dlp setup**: No need to install yt-dlp yourself—Ripify handles that.
- **Remembers your setup**: Your Spotify API keys and other settings are saved in a config file.

## 🛠️ Getting Started

### 1. Download  
Head over to the [Releases page](https://github.com/V0idpool/Ripify/releases/) and grab the latest version.

### 2. Build (if needed)  
If you're building from source, open `Ripify.sln` in Visual Studio and build it like any standard C# project.

### 3. First Time Running It  
When you launch Ripify for the first time:
- It’ll create a `UserCFG.ini` file if one doesn’t exist.
- You’ll be asked to enter your Spotify `ClientID` and `ClientSecret`.
- You will need to put a copy of your cookies file containing your logged in youtube account, this is to bypass age restriction or private content checks.
- Use this in chrome browser with youtube.com open, and export the cookies to a text file: https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/get-cookiestxt-locally/cclelndahbckbenkjhflpdbgdldlbecc
- Name the text file cookies.txt and place it in the same directory as Ripify.
